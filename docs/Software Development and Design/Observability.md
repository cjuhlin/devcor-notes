# Observability

## Three pillar

### Logs

### Metrics

### Tracing

Tracing use unique id for every event together with information regarding:

which service did a request go through

what did every microservice do when processing the request

if the request was slow where was the bottleneck

if the request failed , where did the error occur. 

How different was the execution of the request from normal behavior of the  system
