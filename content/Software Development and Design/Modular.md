# Modular

## Pros

* More flexible
* Easier to break down everything into smaller stones, which is perfect for a project so everything doesn't need to be one giant project, and instead you can break it down into smaller projects.
* Code is easier to understand, debugging, and test. 
* The code is easier to clean up (refactor)

Also, applies to microservice. 

* Each service has one job (ex. One service is the frontend and one is the backend )
* They communicate with each other over a standard API interface. 
* Can easily be reused for other applications with no change to the application. 
* Easier to [scale](Scalabilty.md)
